# Chess_Engine
Created a chess Engine that can play at a competitive level.
The engine uses a bi-directional search and uses the minimax algorithm to find the best move given a certain depth.
The positions are evaluated based on the value of the pieces, positioning of the pieces and calculation depth.

Further improvements:
Time management can be improved by pruning
Depth of search can be improved with a stronger engine
An improvement can be to use a more efficient algorithm or use machine learning to train the AI instead of assigning values.
